## Projects

### Cyber-physical WebAssembly System Interfaces (WASI) Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

A standardized set of interfaces to connect WebAssembly applications to hardware on IoT and edge devises using hardware protocols such as USB and I2C. This also allows building device drivers as WebAssembly components.

* I2C WASI proposal: Phase 2
  * Proposal: https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-i2c
  * Implementation: https://github.com/idlab-discover/i2c-wasm-components
  * Collaboration with Siemens
* USB WASI proposal: Phase 1
  * Proposal: https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-usb
  * Implementation:
